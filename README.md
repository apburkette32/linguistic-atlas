# linguistic-atlas
This project uses data from the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP), which as of July 2018 is housed at UK. This data represents the largest systematically carried out survey of US dialects to date. There are hand-drawn maps from the first regional survey, LANE, from the 1930s that represent how people answered the questions asked.
Steps taken to create project map:
  1) scan LANE papr map at high resolution, upload and georeference that map in QGIS
  2) clean up LANE spreadsheet data (normalize for capitalilzation, typos, etc.)
