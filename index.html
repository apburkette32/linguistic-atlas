		<h1>The Linguistic Atlas of New England</h1>

		<!-- Add you information below -->
		<h2>Authored by: apburkette32 for New Maps Plus</h2>
		<p>The Linguistic Atlas of New England (LANE) is a regional sub-survey of the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP), a linguistic survey of American English that began in 1929 and continues today. LANE was the first of the Atlas surveys, with interviews conducted between 1931 and 1933. The New England speakers that were interviewed were asked a series of questions about words for things: items found around the house and farm, different kinds of weather, social relationships, etc. The map featured above represents the LANE speakers' answers to the question, "What do you call the piece of furniture in your bedroom that has drawers and is where you keep folded items, socks, and such?" </p>
	 	
		<p>LANE and the other regional LAP surveys are now housed at the University of Kentucky. Some of the LAP holdings are digital, but much is paper, including original lithograph maps that were hand-drawn in the 1930s as a way to display the linguistic data collected. Though they are difficult to find today, hundreds LANE maps were produced in the late 30s and are now considered to be "legacy" or "heritage" data. Below is the LANE map for 'bureau' which has been drawn into the 21st century through high-resolution digitization and QGIS georeferencing. Further modernizing the map is the point value layer that has been added, showing the locations of the LANE speakers who gave the responses "highboy" and "chiffonier" to the 'bureau' question. </p>
